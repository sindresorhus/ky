	This hook enables you to modify the request right before it is sent. Ky will make no further changes to the request after this. The hook function receives the normalized request, options, and a state object. You could, for example, modify `request.headers` here.

	The `state.retryCount` is `0` for the initial request and increments with each retry. This allows you to distinguish between initial requests and retries, which is useful when you need different behavior for retries (e.g., avoiding overwriting headers set in `beforeRetry`).

	A [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) can be returned from this hook to completely avoid making a HTTP request. This can be used to mock a request, check an internal cache, etc. An **important** consideration when returning a `Response` from this hook is that all the following hooks will be skipped, so **ensure you only return a `Response` from the last hook**.

	@example
	```
	import ky from 'ky';

	const response = await ky('https://example.com', {
		hooks: {
			beforeRequest: [
				(request, options, {retryCount}) => {
					// Only set default auth header on initial request, not on retries
					// (retries may have refreshed token set by beforeRetry)
					if (retryCount === 0) {
						request.headers.set('Authorization', 'token initial-token');
					}
				}
			]
		}

	/**
	This hook enables you to modify the request right before retry. Ky will make no further changes to the request after this. The hook function receives an object with the normalized request and options, an error instance, and the retry count. You could, for example, modify `request.headers` here.

	The hook can return a [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) to replace the outgoing retry request, or return a [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) to skip the retry and use that response instead. **Note:** Returning a request or response skips remaining `beforeRetry` hooks.

	If the request received a response, the error will be of type `HTTPError` and the `Response` object will be available at `error.response`. Be aware that some types of errors, such as network errors, inherently mean that a response was not received. In that case, the error will not be an instance of `HTTPError`.

	You can prevent Ky from retrying the request by throwing an error. Ky will not handle it in any way and the error will be propagated to the request initiator. The rest of the `beforeRetry` hooks will not be called in this case. Alternatively, you can return the [`ky.stop`](#ky.stop) symbol to do the same thing but without propagating an error (this has some limitations, see `ky.stop` docs for details).

	**Modifying headers:**

	@example
	```
	import ky from 'ky';

	const response = await ky('https://example.com', {
		hooks: {
			beforeRetry: [
				async ({request, options, error, retryCount}) => {
					const token = await ky('https://example.com/refresh-token');
					request.headers.set('Authorization', `token ${token}`);
				}
			]
		}
	});
	```

	**Modifying the request URL:**

	@example
	```
	import ky from 'ky';

	const response = await ky('https://example.com/api', {
		hooks: {
			beforeRetry: [
				async ({request, error}) => {
					// Add query parameters based on error response
					if (error.response) {
						const body = await error.response.json();
						const url = new URL(request.url);
						url.searchParams.set('processId', body.processId);
						return new Request(url, request);
					}
				}
			]
		}
	});
	```

	**Returning a cached response:**

	@example
	```
	import ky from 'ky';

	const response = await ky('https://example.com/api', {
		hooks: {
			beforeRetry: [
				({error, retryCount}) => {
					// Use cached response instead of retrying
					if (retryCount > 1 && cachedResponse) {
						return cachedResponse;
					}
				}
			]
		}
	});
	```

						// Retry with the token
						options.headers.set('Authorization', `token ${token}`);
